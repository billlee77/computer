   1. Install a program called chntpw
      $ sudo apt-get install chntpw
   2. After successfully installing chntpw, you have to access the Windows NTFS partition by mounting it and allowing read/write support. A good tutorial on how to do this can be found HERE.
   3. After that, use your command line skills by navigating to WINDOWS/system32/config
   4. Once inside the config directory, issue this command:
      $ sudo chntpw SAM
   5. A long display of information will follow. Just ignore them.
   6. Once you are prompted to reset the password, it is recommended to leave the password blank with an asterisk (*).
   7. Reboot, and you can now login to Windows with full administrative access.
