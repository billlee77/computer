# NOTE:
#   All these options are the defaults if you run logwatch with no
#   command-line arguments.  You can override all of these on the
#   command-line. 

# You can put comments anywhere you want to.  They are effective for the
# rest of the line.

# this is in the format of <name> = <value>.  Whitespace at the beginning
# and end of the lines is removed.  Whitespace before and after the = sign
# is removed.  Everything is case *insensitive*.

# Yes = True  = On  = 1
# No  = False = Off = 0

# Default Log Directory
# All log-files are assumed to be given relative to this directory.
LogDir = /var/log

# You can override the default temp directory (/tmp) here
TmpDir = /tmp

# Default person to mail reports to.  Can be a local account or a
# complete email address.
MailTo = root

# If set to 'Yes', the report will be sent to stdout instead of being
# mailed to above person.
Print = No

# Leave this to 'Yes' if you have the mktemp program and it supports
# the '-d' option.  Some older version of mktemp on pre-RH7.X did not
# support this option, so set this to no in that case and Logwatch will
# use internal temp directory creation that is (hopefully) just as secure
UseMkTemp = Yes

#
#	Some systems have mktemp in a different place
#
MkTemp = /bin/mktemp

# if set, the results will be saved in <filename> instead of mailed
# or displayed.
#Save = /tmp/logwatch

# Use archives?  If set to 'Yes', the archives of logfiles
# (i.e. /var/log/messages.1 or /var/log/messages.1.gz) will
# be searched in addition to the /var/log/messages file.
# This usually will not do much if your range is set to just
# 'Yesterday' or 'Today'... it is probably best used with
# Archives = Yes
# Range = All

# The default time range for the report...
# The current choices are All, Today, Yesterday
Range = yesterday

# The default detail level for the report.
# This can either be Low, Med, High or a number.
# Low = 0
# Med = 5
# High = 10
Detail = Low


# The 'Service' option expects either the name of a filter
# (in /etc/log.d/scripts/services/*) or 'All'.
# The default service(s) to report on.  This should be left as All for
# most people.  
Service = All
# You can also disable certain services (when specifying all)
#Service = -zz-fortune
# If you only cared about FTP messages, you could use these 2 lines
# instead of the above:
#Service = ftpd-messages   # Processes ftpd messages in /var/log/messages
#Service = ftpd-xferlog    # Processes ftpd messages in /var/log/xferlog
# Maybe you only wanted reports on PAM messages, then you would use:
#Service = pam_pwdb     # PAM_pwdb messages - usually quite a bit
#Service = pam          # General PAM messages... usually not many

# You can also choose to use the 'LogFile' option.  This will cause
# logwatch to only analyze that one logfile.. for example:
#LogFile = messages
# will process /var/log/messages.  This will run all the filters that 
# process that logfile.  This option is probably not too useful to
# most people.  Setting 'Service' to 'All' above analyizes all LogFiles
# anyways...

#
# some systems have different locations for mailers
#
#mailer = /bin/mail
# gh - 06.09.20
# copied over from polaris
# By default we assume that all Unix systems have sendmail or a sendmail-like system.
# The mailer code Prints a header with To: From: and Subject:.
# At this point you can change the mailer to any thing else that can handle that output
# stream. TODO test variables in the mailer string to see if the To/From/Subject can be 
set
# From here with out breaking anything. This would allow mail/mailx/nail etc..... -mgt 
mailer = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"

#
# With this option set to 'Yes', only log entries for this particular host
# (as returned by 'hostname' command) will be processed.  The hostname
# can also be overridden on the commandline (with --hostname option).  This
# can allow a log host to process only its own logs, or Logwatch can be
# run once per host included in the logfiles. 
#
# The default is to report on all log entries, regardless of its source host.
# Note that some logfiles do not include host information and will not be
# influenced by this setting.
#
#HostLimit = Yes
