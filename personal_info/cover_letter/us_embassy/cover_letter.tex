\opening{Dear Madam/Sir:}

I am writing to apply for a B-1 visa to allow me to travel to the Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia. I am
currently a Master of Science student in the Department of Physics at the
University of Regina, Canada.  My research is conducted under the supervision
of Dr.Garth Huber, who has over 20 years of research experience at JLab. For
research purposes, I need to attend 2-3 collaboration meetings per year and
specialized workshop (2-3 times per year) through to the end of 2013.  All of
my expenses will be covered by research grant funds provided to the University
of Regina by the Government of Canada, and my insurance is covered by JLab.

Previously, I was at Pennsylvania State University for a one year exchange as
a student from the University of Kent, U.K.

In order to support my application, I have enclosed the following documentation
for your review:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Invitation Letter from the JLab Hall C Group Leader
	\item Endorsement Letter from Dr. Garth Huber 
	\item Position Appointment Letter and Tuition Payment Record from University of Regina
	\item Canadian Student Visa and Study Permit
	\item Curriculum Vitae
	\item Statement of My Research Activity
	\item Transcripts from Pennsylvania State University and the University
	of Kent
	\item Expired US Student Visa from 2009
\end{enumerate}

Many thanks for your consideration, and I am looking forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
