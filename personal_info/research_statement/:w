\section*{Past Research}

At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Research Description} ~ During three month stay at Kalsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, I worked as internship student for Pierre Auger Experiment on a research project titled \emph{Star Tracking with the High Elevation Auger Telescopes (HEAT)}. I started the project with simulating 


\item \textbf{Research Achievement} ~ Developed the algorithm for identifying mis-cabled photomultiplier tube of florescences telescopes for Pierre Auger Experiment.
 
\item \textbf{Computer Package Used} ~ Offline, C++, ROOT, SVN.

\end{itemize}

At University at Kent at Canterbury 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Research Description} ~ The research I am currently undertaking at University of Kent as final year project, tittled \emph{Investigation of Far Ultraviolet (FUV) radition induced shockwave velocity in H2 region}. My role is to use existing Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation to generate velocity, density, temperature and energy profile at each time step, further to write a data analysis code and look into the data profiles.

\item \textbf{Research Achievement} ~ Obtained the relationship between shock-wave velocity and initial condition of molecular cloud.  

\item \textbf{Computer Package Used} ~ IDL, C++, ROOT, FORTRAN 90, SVN, FFMPEG.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Current Research}


% \paragraph{Research Overview}
% The top priority of all particle physicists is to seek the fundamental building
% blocks of matter, and further understand the interaction between
% them. Right now, the smallest building blocks of our world are known as quarks
% and leptons; however, the answer to the question:\\
% \emph{How do quarks interact inside of proton and neutrons?} \\ 
% remains a mystery.  The standard method to research this subject is to use
% electron scattering, i.e. to accelerate electrons at high momenta and collide
% with a hydrogen target then look at the products after the interaction.
% 
% The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerating Facility (JLab), located in Newport
% News, Virginia, is the world leading electron accelerating facility.  It has
% been used by scientists around the world for research in subatomic and medical
% physics. In 2008, JLab was approved by the U.S. Department of Energy for a
% U.S.\$310 million upgrade to increase the maximum electron beam energy from 6 GeV to
% 12 GeV and build new experimental facilities.  This upgrade is in progress
% with a projected completion date of 2015.
% 
% \paragraph{Personal Research Role}
% The JLab 12 GeV upgrade calls for new set of experimental equipment to detect
% produced particles at higher momenta.  In Experimental Hall C of JLab, the
% Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) will be installed as part of the
% upgrade.  The essential role of the SHMS is to allow scientists to distinguish
% different particle types and precisely measure their momenta and angles of
% emission. A part of the SHMS instrumentation known as the Heavy Gas Cerenkov
% Detector used for particle identification is being constructed at the
% University of Regina with funds provided by the Government of Canada.  My
% supervisor at the University of Regina, Dr. Garth Huber, has over 20 years of
% research experience at JLab, and his work on the \emph{Charged Pion Form
% Factor} is one of the signature results to come from the Hall C Group at
% JLab. My work is to assist Dr. Garth Huber with the construction of the Heavy
% Gas Cerenkov Detector, and to perform experiments to test and the calibrate
% detectors at the early running stage.

\section*{Future Research Goal}
\begin{description}
\item[Motivation] ~As future research ambition, I am willing to tackle the subject of the elementary particle physics. The interests towards this subject was developed gradually during the undergraduate study, due to the demand of the understanding the behaviour of elementary particles. Unfortunately neitherclassical mechanics nor quantum mechanics can offer a full explanation to my demand. I have decided to take unsolved question a steo further to the research level, to boost my knowledgen as well as discoverting new science. 

\item[PhD Research] ~For the PhD research, I would desire any topic in studying the elemetary particle physics, such as quark model, QCD and QED, etc.
