Midas Installation notes

******************************

Note:
The basic steps of midas installation is explained under:
https://www.triumf.info/wiki/DAQwiki/index.php/Setup_MIDAS_experiment

This documentation will summarize the procedure. 




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


Step 1: Setup environment variable 

Edit .cshrc file and add the following

##############################

setenv LANG C

setenv CVS_RSH ssh
setenv MIDASSYS $HOME/packages/midas
setenv ROOTSYS  $HOME/packages/root
setenv MIDAS_EXPTAB $HOME/experiment/exptab

# setup the MIDAS mserver

switch (`hostname`)
case larch*:
    unsetenv MIDAS_SERVER_HOST
    breaksw
default:
    setenv MIDAS_SERVER_HOST larch.phys.uregina.ca:7071
endsw

# select 64-bit or 32-bit MIDAS and ROOT

@ switch (`uname -i`)
@ case i386:
@    #export ROOTSYS=/triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_v5.20.00_SL45_32
@    setenv ROOTSYS /triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_v5.28.00_SL55_32
@    setenv PATH .:$MIDASSYS/linux-m32/bin:$PATH
@    breaksw
@ default:
@    #export ROOTSYS=/triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_v5.26.00b_SL54_64
@    #setenv ROOTSYS /triumfcs/trshare/olchansk/root/root_v5.28.00_SL55_64
@    setenv ROOTSYS $HOME/packages/root
@    setenv PATH .:$MIDASSYS/linux/bin:$PATH
@ endsw

*setenv PATH .:$HOME/online/bin:$HOME/packages/roody/bin:$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
*setenv PATH .:$HOME/packages/roody/bin

#end


*setenv SVN_EDITOR "emacs -nw"
*setenv GIT_EDITOR "emacs -nw"

##############################

@ option will set according to the root directory installation, PLEASE DO NOT set $ROOTSYS this way if the root is installed from the distribution, i.e RPMs.

* options are optional depending on user preferences.

Step 2: Packages checkout and compilation 

Note: Root installation will not be covered here

******************************
Install MIDAS

$ cd $HOME/packages
$ svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/repos/meg/midas/trunk midas 
(Password "svn"). (password has to be entered twice)
$ svn co svn+ssh://svn@savannah.psi.ch/repos/meg/mxml/trunk mxml
$ cd midas
$ make
$ check that linux/bin/odbedit has been created


******************************
Install ROOTANA
    
$ cd $HOME/packages
$ svn checkout https://ladd00.triumf.ca/svn/rootana/trunk rootana 
(say "p" to accept the ladd00 ssl certificate, use username "svn", password "svn")
$ cd rootana
$ make


******************************
Install ROODY

$ cd $HOME/packages
$ svn checkout https://ladd00.triumf.ca/svn/roody/trunk roody
$ cd roody
$ make
$ $HOME/packages/roody/bin/roody




******************************
Compilation ROOT library Issue regarding the root-config command

If the root is installed with the RPM form the linux distribution, command in Makefile:

shell  $(ROOTSYS)/bin/root-config --libs

will not be able to load the root library path. Change this line to 
shell  /root-config --libs

and then problem fixed.

User may or may not install extra root packages from the distribution.

Step 3: Configurations & Trouble shoot

Note: this section is most important.

******************************
There are many ways to setup experiments 

I would introduce our way of setting up.

The main experiment directory is in:
$HOME/experiment

And there are many sub experiments under this dir.
There is main exptab file under
$HOME/experiment 
to collect the information for all sub experiments, and each sub experiments have their own exptab which only contain sub experiments info. 
 

******************************
exptab file

exptab file setting is extremely important.

It contains the experiments information of Experiment name, Experiment Dir and User name 	  

Example: 
	gaintest      /home/midasdaq2/experiment/gaintest    midasdaq2
	simpletest    /home/midasdaq2/experiment/simple_test midasdaq2
	muon-test     /home/midasdaq2/experiment/muon08-test midasdaq2

The main exptab file (under $HOME/experiment/) should have information for all sub experiments, the exptab file in sub experiments should only contain its information.




******************************
File sourcing when ./start_daq.sh

When data acquisition system starts, the start_daq.sh script will try to source the setup.sh, one MUST check if the setup.sh is set up correctly. 

Please always set $MIDAS_EXPTAB to:
	export MIDAS_EXPTAB=./exptab


Other setting are optional.


******************************
Resolve the root privilege issue

With CAMAC crate, in order to access the controlle, one need to use
$dio ./frontend
command to bypass the driver. If Midas is not install on root account, dio owner must be changed to root.

If 64 bits do:
$ su -c "chown root $MIDASSYS/linux/bin/dio"
$ su -c "chgrp root $MIDASSYS/linux/bin/dio"

and 32 bits do:
$ su -c "chown root $MIDASSYS/linux-m32/bin/dio"
$ su -c "chgrp root $MIDASSYS/linux-m32/bin/dio"

Then set user or group ID on execution
$ su -c "chmod a+s $MIDASSYS/linux/bin/dio"
or 
$ su -c "chmod a+s $MIDASSYS/linux-m32/bin/dio"

Warning! If this procedure is not done, dio will require root privilege to execute. Which implies no other user is able to run frontend and collect data!






******************************
Step 4: Get started with an example experiment

1. Copy $MIDASSYS/examples/experiment/ to $HOME/experiment/testexperiment

2. Edit both exptab files,

3. check setup.sh (IMPORTANT)

4. make

5. ./startdaq

6. firefox localhost:8081
