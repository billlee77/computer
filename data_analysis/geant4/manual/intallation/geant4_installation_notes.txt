	GEANT4 INSTALLATION NOTES FOR FEDORA-10
	09.02.19

1. Install CLHEP

   clhep-2.0.4.2.tar.gz

   Create directories /home/apps/clhep/source and build.

   Instructions from source/INSTALL:

   Unwind the source code tar ball in the source directory.
   Autoconf and automake will aready have been run.  
   Determine where the files will be installed.
   Create a build directory that is NOT in the source code directory tree.

   cd <build_directory>
   <source_code_directory>/configure --prefix=<install_dir>
      (Note that files will be installed under /usr/local if you do not 
       specify a prefix.)
   make
      (Build temporary copies of libraries and executables.)
   make check
      (Run the tests.)
   make install
      (Copy libraries, headers, executables, etc. to relevant 
       subdirectories under <install_dir>.)

2. Install Geant4 Data Libraries

   G4ABLA.3.0.tar.gz   
   G4EMLOW.5.1.tar.gz  
   G4EMLOW.6.2.tar.gz  
   G4NDL.0.2.tar.gz
   G4NDL.3.13.tar.gz
   G4RadioactiveDecay.3.2.tar.gz
   PhotonEvaporation.2.0.tar.gz

   Create /home/apps/geant4/data and unpack tar files in data directory.

3. Install Geant4

   geant4.9.2.tar.gz

   Unpack tar file in geant4 directory.

   Execute the Configure script, following the instructions regarding the
   location of CLHEP and the Data files, and selecting the various options 
   on which visualization libraries to create.
	./Configure -build
   The compilation will take quite a long time.

   In case the installation procedure fails for some reason, or you 
   realize the selected options were not correct, you can repeat the 
   process manually with:
        cd geant4/source
        make clean

   In case new modules need to be added to an existing build, this can be 
   done manually by re-running Configure and providing the new settings.

   Once the process of building the libraries has been completed 
   successfully, the Geant4 toolkit can be installed by typing:
        ./Configure -install

4. Install Root

   root_v5.22.00.source.tar.gz

   Create /home/apps/root and unpack tar file.
   Execute configure script, and then make.

   Note that on gridiron, I experienced a number of compilation errors.
   To get around them I needed to do:
     configure --disable-asimage --disable-xrootd --disable-reflex
   so that the problem areas would not be compiled.

5. Install Geant4 visualization utilities:

   HepRApp.jar in <user>/geant4/bin/Linux-g++/HepRAPP.jar
   Run via: java -jar HepRAapp.jar

   jas3 in /home/apps/jas3
   jas3-Linux-0.8.3.tar.gz
   Once application is up, need to enable the following Plugins:
   HepRep Plugin
   WIRED 3 Graphics Format
   WIRED 4
   WIRED 4 Base Library
   WIRED CORBA HepRep Client Plugin

   dawn in /home/apps/dawn
   dawn_3_88a.tar.gz --> unpack and then make.

   Note regarding Java:

   HepRApp and jas3 require the full set of JRE libraries and not the minimal
   gcj version that comes with some Linux distributions.  To check if the
   installed version of java is adequate type:  java -version
   If the output info mentions gcj then you will need to download and install
   JRE from the Sun website.  Be sure that /usr/bin/java points to the new
   version.

6. Set environment variables in .cshrc:

   setenv CLHEP_LIB_DIR /usr/local/lib
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/apps/geant4/lib/Linux-g++:/usr/local/lib/:.:/home/apps/root/lib
   setenv CLHEP_BASE_DIR /usr/local
   setenv CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIR /usr/local/include
   #setenv CLHEP_LIB CLHEP
   setenv ROOTSYS /home/apps/root
   set path=($path $ROOTSYS/bin /home/apps/jas3 /home/apps/dawn)
   setenv DAWN_PS_PREVIEWER gv
   setenv G4DAWNFILE_VIEWER 'dawn -d'

   and in .login:
   source /home/apps/geant4/.config/bin/Linux-g++/env.csh
   set path=($path $G4WORKDIR/bin)
