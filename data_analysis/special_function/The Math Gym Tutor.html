				<h4>Graphing Functions and Derivatives</h4>
				<p>Graphing a function along with it's first and second derivatives just from the shape of the original function.
				In this case, the function (in red) is y = 24/(x<sup>2</sup> + 12). 
Since the slope of the function is zero at x=0, the first derivative 
function must have a value y=0 at x=0
				If you imagine sliding a tangent line along the red curve at each 
point from the left to the right, it starts out nearly flat, then rises 
to a maximum, somewhere
				between -4 and zero, having a value zero at x=0. This produces the 
left half of the curve in green. Similarly for the right half. The 
second derivative curve follows
				from reapplying this trick over again, to give you a curve that has 
the general shape in gold.

				<span style="color:deepskyblue"><h2>The Math/Gym Analogy</h2></span>

				<h3><p>It's easy to fall behind in schools, particularly in a 
subject area such as Math or Science.
				After a student falls behind, it becomes a frightening ordeal as new
 material is presented, and the student struggles to keep up
				with the material they're supposed to know.
				Pretty soon the student drops out and may develop resentment for the
 subject and teachers.
				Sometimes they think they're not smart enough, and develop math 
anxiety, and avoid anything that uses any math.
				Ultimately, the student also avoids careers that use any Math. This 
is certainly not the answer, especially in today high tech world.</p>

				<p>The truth is that <span style="color:deepskyblue">anyone</span> can be good in math. However it does take some regular time devoted in developing the basic skills that will
				serve as a foundation for the higher levels, and ultimately greater career choices.
				Math like athletics, requires <a href="#" onmouseout="popUp(event,'t2')" onmouseover="popUp(event,'t2')" onclick="return false">structure and discipline.</a>

				</p><p>Math is one subject that is best approached a little at a 
time and with regular workout intervals.
				Even as little as 15 minutes a day in focused daily problem solving 
can dramatically increase one's proficiency, confidence and remove
				that 'pit in the stomach' that many have developed over their past 
lack of success.</p>

				<p>It's also important that goals be set. Some goals are more long 
term than others.
				Improving your grade is may be your goal in the short run, while a 
longer goal might be acquire a better understanding of the subject.
				This depends on how much the student commits themselves to achieving
 the goal.
				As long as you have a goal, I will help you create a plan, where and
 how much to spend your time in given topic area.</p>

				<p>Summary:
				</p><ul>
					<li>Learn the rules of the game</li>
					<li>Reinforce these rules through exercises. We learn by repetition. Work out similar problems until it becomes second nature</li>
					<li>Computation first, understanding comes more naturally later (don't and try to understand too much at first)</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p></h3>

				<span style="color:deepskyblue"><h2>The Tutor/Coach</h2></span>

				<h3><p>Having a good tutor or coach who can pay attention to the 
individual problems and help the student identify the problem area is 
crucial.
				A tutor serves not only to present the material to the student, but 
should be perceptive to the students own needs, shortcomings, and fears.
				Based on the level the student is at, a tutor should provide an 
overview and plan in a general area, that the student would use over 
some
				time (perhaps after the tutor is no longer with the student), to 
continually gain greater proficiency.</p>

				<p>The tutor/student relationship should be one of personal comfort.
				The student should feel unencumbered and unafraid to confide in any 
fears they have on the subject.
				This should be quite unlike many of the peer-peer relationship in 
school, where students are often afraid to ask questions or
				even volunteer an answer for fear of ridicule, even though they 
themselves probably have the same questions.</p>

				<p>I do however stress problem solving at regular intervals. 
Initially, many of the skills may be rote problem solving that test the 
techniques,
				rather than how smart the student really is. Depending on the 
student, understanding gradually comes.
				Over time, as the student learns to understand why these techniques 
produces correct the answers, they are more likely to remember and
				reconstruct arguments long after their detailed memory has failed.</p>

				<p>When I meet you for the first time, we will spend the first 
fifteen minutes (at no extra charge) getting to know each other and what
 are each of our expectations.</p>
