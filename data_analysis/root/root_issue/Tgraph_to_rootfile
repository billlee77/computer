Only TH1 and TTree objects are automatically registered to
gDirectory->GetList(). TGraphs are not.

You can register any TObject derived object (eg TGraph) to this list with a
statement like
  gDirectory->Append(mygraph);
where TGraph *mygraph is an already existing TGraph.

You can replace your saveAll function with
   gDirectory->Write();
This statement will write all objects registered in the directory.

To see the list of objects in a directory, do
  dir->ls(), eg gDirectory->ls();
