# Angle Radian Conversion

# PLANE ANGLE CONVERSIONS

#(Plane, 2-dimensional) angles may be converted with the following functions.

    * deg2rad

         1. $radians = deg2rad($degrees);

    * grad2rad

         1. $radians = grad2rad($gradians);

    * rad2deg

         1. $degrees = rad2deg($radians);

    * grad2deg

         1. $degrees = grad2deg($gradians);

    * deg2grad

         1. $gradians = deg2grad($degrees);

    * rad2grad

         1. $gradians = rad2grad($radians);

# The full circle is 2 pi radians or 360 degrees or 400 gradians. The result is by default wrapped to be inside the [0, {2pi,360,400}[ circle. If you don't want this, supply a true second argument:

   1. $zillions_of_radians = deg2rad($zillions_of_degrees, 1);
   2. $negative_degrees = rad2deg($negative_radians, 1);

#You can also do the wrapping explicitly by rad2rad(), deg2deg(), and grad2grad().

    * rad2rad
         1. $radians_wrapped_by_2pi = rad2rad($radians);

    * deg2deg
         1. $degrees_wrapped_by_360 = deg2deg($degrees);

    * grad2grad
         1. $gradians_wrapped_by_400 = grad2grad($gradians);
