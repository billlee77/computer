There are three ways to pass a array to the function in c++:

	* Pass as a pointer:
		void foo(int* a)

	* pass as a reference:
		void foo(int(&a) [10])

	* pass as array (pointer?):
		void foo(int a[])


	NOTE there are restriction as the second method to pass around array, the size of the array must be known, 
	including the array size in main and function.
