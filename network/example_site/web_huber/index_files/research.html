<h3>1. The Central Scientific Question</h3>

The Standard Model of particle physics now lies at the center of much nuclear
physics research.  One of the basic elements of the Standard Model, the
existence of quarks and gluons, was first inferred from the spectrum of
elementary particles and from electron-scattering experiments.  Susequently,
Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) was developed to describe them.  Just as the
formulation of Maxwell's equations led to a quantitative understanding of
electromagnetic phenomena in the late 19th century, so the development of QCD a
century later has provided the theoretical foundation for the understanding of
many strong interaction phenomena.<p>

While a very good theoretical framework (called Quantum Chromo-Dynammics, or
QCD) is able to accurately describe how quarks and gluons interact at extremely
high energies (or, equivalently, when the quarks are very close together), it
has been very difficult to apply QCD to lower energy (larger distance)
phenomena.  The paradox is that the increasing complexity of the quark-gluon
interaction as they get further apart is critically important to their observed
confinement within nucleons and mesons (the nuclear building-blocks), but we
cannot perform the QCD calculations necessary to confirm our understanding.
This is because in the ``confinement regime'' the quark-gluon coupling strength
is too large to allow perturbative theoretic methods to be reliably used.<p>

One of the central problems of modern physics remains the connection of the
observed properties of the nuclear building blocks (protons, neutrons, mesons)
to the underlying theoretical framework provided by QCD.  I have a leadership
role in a number of experiments designed to make detailed comparisons with QCD
predictions, and so advance our understanding of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics in the
``confinement regime''.<p>

For the past decade, my research program has been primarily concentrated in
Hall C of Jefferson Lab.  Jefferson Lab is the world's premier nuclear physics
facility, with intense, high quality, polarized electron beams of energy
up to 6 GeV, optimized to perform a wide variety of hadron structure
measurements, as alluded to above.  In September, 2008, construction approval
was given to double the beam energy available at Jefferson Lab to 12 GeV and to
upgrade the detector systems.  This will allow a new generation of very
promising and very interesting experiments to study the structure of hadronic
matter.  This work is now ongoing, and it is anticipated that the first higher
energy electron beams will be available in late 2014.  I have involved in both
the scientific and detector preparations of the upgraded facility, as explained
below.<p>

In the meantime, we have a 2009-2014 window of opportunity for a new
research program to be directed toward the newly-upgraded Institute of Nuclear
Physics in Mainz, Germany.  Recent upgrades to the Mainz microtron
(high-quality, high-flux cw 1.5 GeV electron beam providing a beam of polarized
photons), refurbished near- 4 pi CB-TAPS detector system, and frozen-spin
polarized proton target, will allow unique access to high-precision
measurements of proton structure.  These are also explained below.<p>

<h3>2. Pion Measurements</h3>

The pion are the lightest strongly-interacting system, with a relatively simple
<i>q-qbar</i> valence quark structure.  As a result, QCD calculations are
expected to be somewhat simpler for pions than for more complex particles
such as protons and neutrons, and so the pion occupies an important place in
our understanding of hadrons.
<p>

<h4>2a. Pion Charge Form Factor</h4>

The flagship experiment of my research program is the measurement of the pion
form factor (F<sub>pi</sub>).  The long-term interest in the
<i>pi<sup>+</sup></i> electric form factor is due to Farrar and Jackson [PRL
<b>43</b>(1979)246], who showed that the F<sub>pi</sub> is rigorously
calculable in pQCD.  Their answer is exact and model-independent at infinite
<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>, dependent only on the assumption of quark asymptotic
freedom.  Such a reliable result is rare in QCD.  However, it is not known at
what region of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> the value of F<sub>pi</sub> will reflect
the onset of pQCD and this value, as well as the actual behavior of
F<sub>pi</sub> as a function of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> in the non-perturbative
transition region, are important tests of our understanding of QCD in bound
hadron systems.  This is especially important, because the smaller number of
valence quarks in the pion means that the asymptotic regime will be reached at
lower values of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> than for the nucleon form factors.<p>

width="500"><br>
</center>

At low <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i><0.3 GeV<sup>2</sup>, the pion form factor is
dominated by ``soft'' contributions, which are parameterized in terms of the
pion rms charge radius.  Our experiment at Jefferson Laboratory is intended to
address the description of F<sub>pi</sub> in the gap between these ``soft'' and
``hard'' (pQCD) regions.  This is where considerable theoretical effort has
been expended in recent years.  Some examples include next-to-leading order
(NLO) QCD, QCD Sum Rules, Constituent Quark Models, and Bethe-Salpeter Equation
calculations.  Some of these approaches are more model-independent than others,
but it is fair to say that all benefit from comparison to high quality
F<sub>pi</sub> data, to delineate the role of hard versus soft contributions at
intermediate <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>.  Lattice QCD simulations are not yet at the
point where their uncertainties are smaller than those of the experimental
data, but we anticipate this to occur in the next generation of lattice
simulations.  Since all QCD-based calculations use the pion as a first test
case (the hydrogen atom, or more accurately, positronium atom of QCD), it is
clear that F<sub>pi</sub> will continue to be a topic of attention for some
time.<p>

The high quality, continuous electron beam of Jefferson Lab (JLab) makes these
measurements possible. The measurement of the pion form factor is quite
challenging.  Since pion targets do not exist experimentally, the pion form
factor cannot be measured directly above <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>>0.3
GeV<sup>2</sup>.  For practical purposes it must be deduced from a careful
study of the longitudinal and transverse (L/T) cross sections for p(e,e'pi+)n
kinematics selected to enhance the sensitive t-channel process and to minimize
background contributions.  The high quality electron beam and well-understood
magnetic spectrometers at Jefferson Lab offer the possibility to measure this
form factor to good precision.  There is no other existing or planned facility
worldwide at which this program could be pursued.<p>

Our collaboration has acquired data in Hall C in two experiments to date, and
these results have been published (see the press releases above).
The Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade will allow F<sub>pi</sub> measurements to be
obtained at higher <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> and challenge QCD calculations in the
most rigorous manner.  The pion form factor is expected to be an important part
of the program of an upgraded Hall C, and as such it has gone through a number
of external scientific and technical reviews.  In 2000, our proposed
measurement to <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>=6 GeV<sup>2</sup> was first reviewed by a
special 12 GeV JLab PAC, who concluded <i>``this measurement will be an
important contribution to our knowledge of hadronic structure and is ideally
and uniquely suited to the 12 GeV energy upgrade physics program''.</i> This
was endorsed by the U.S. Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) in its April
2002 report: <i>``Another important issue in the physics of confinement is
understanding the transition of the behavior of QCD from long distance scales
(low <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>) to short distance scales (high
<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>).  The pion is one of the simplest QCD systems available
for study, and the measurement of its elastic form factor is the best hope for
seeing this transition experimentally.''</i> In August, 2006, we received
formal scientific approval for our experiment from Jefferson Lab PAC 30 and 56
days of beam were awarded [E12-06-101: "Measurement of the Charged Pion Form
Factor to High Q<sup>2</sup>", G.M. Huber - UofR, D.Gaskell - JLab
(co-spokespersons)].  A final review will be necessary once the upgrade of the
accelerator and experimental equipment are near completion.<p>

<h4>2b. QCD Scaling Tests using Exclusive Pion Production</h4>

A related 12 GeV experiment [``Scaling Study of the L-T Separated Pion 
Electroproduction Cross Section at 11 GeV'', E12-07-105, T. Horn - JLab, G.M. Huber 
- UofR (so-spokespersons)] was approved by Jefferson Lab PAC 32 and 42
days of beam awarded.  The purpose of this experiment is to measure the
<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> dependence of the longitudinal and transverse
<i>p(e,e'pi<sup>+</sup>)n</i> cross sections at constant
<i>x</i>=0.31,0.40 and 0.50.  The longitudinal cross sections will provide
a test of whether the data have, or are evolving towards the
1/<i>Q<sup>6</sup></i> scaling prediction for hard exclusive processes.
Similarly, the transverse cross sections are expected to scale as
1/<i>Q<sup>8</sup></i>.  The extraction of Generalized Parton Distributions from
hard exclusive reactions relies on the factorization of the amplitude into hard
and soft processes.  This can only occur if the longitudinal component is
dominant and that the cross sections scale in the expected manner.  PAC 32
concurred with our assessment, stating ``A detailed study to determine whether
or not meson electroproduction can provide information on GPDs is important.''

<h4>2c. Super HMS Spectrometer</h4>

Our experiments are proposed to use a new SHMS spectrometer in coincidence with
the existing HMS spectrometer in Hall C.  The requirements upon this 11 GeV/c
spectrometer are 5.5 degree forward angle capability, and good systematic error
control in the L/T separation at high luminosity.  .  Regina responsibilities
include the design work for the heavy gas (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>)
Cerenkov detector required for good <i>pi</i> identification in the SHMS.
The present schedule of the JLab upgrade anticipates that first commissioning
of the higher energy beam and spectrometer to occur in 2014.<p>

<h3>3. Nucleon Structure Measurements</h3>

With three valence quarks, the nucleon form factors are the next level up
in complexity after the pion.  In particular, they allow the further study of
soft QCD processes.<p>

<h4>3a. Proton Spin Polarizabilities</h4>

Nucleon polarizabilities are fundamental structure observables like the charge
and mass, but are related to the nucleon's internal dynamics, making them
ideally suited for constraining QCD-based models of nucleon structure.
Although the two scalar (spin-independent) polarizabilities alpha_E1 and
beta_M1,
are well understood, very few experiments have attempted to extract
the spin polarizabilities, which can be written as gamma_E1E1,
gamma_M1M1, gamma_M1E2, and gamma_E1M2, and none have managed
to separate all four.  Unlike the scalar
polarizabilities, these higher order polarizabilities unfortunately have no
classical analog, but can be thought of as parameterizing the ``stiffness'' of
the nucleon spin against electromagnetically induced deformations relative to
the nucleon spin axis.<p>

In order to extract all four spin polarizabilities, it will be necessary to
conduct double-polarization (beam and target) asymmetry measurements under
different conditions.  We will use the known static
polarizabilities along with the values of gamma_0 and gamma_pi to
eliminate two of the spin polarizabilities, and then vary the remaining two
and fit to the data.  Specifically, we will need to use:

<ol>

<li>Circularly polarized photons near threshold and in the Delta_1232
resonance region, in concert with a longitudinally (transversely) polarized
target, to determine gamma_M1M1 (gamma_E1E1).</li>

<li>
Linearly polarized photons (phi=0 vs.90deg) in both
energy regions, but in particular near the resonance, to allow for
the extraction of gamma_M1M1 with an unpolarized target, and of
gamma_E1E1 with the target polarized perpendicular to the scattering
plane.</li>

<li>Linearly polarized (phi=45deg vs.135deg) photons in the
resonance region with both longitudinally and transversely polarized
targets in order to access gamma_E1E1 and gamma_M1M1.  In this case, we
expect the asymmetries themselves to be relatively small, i.e. on the
5-10% level, but the effects of the spin polarizabilities to be very large.
Due to the excellent experimental capabilities, it should be possible to
measure asymmetries to the few percent level.</li>

</ol>

Using these different experimental conditions should result in the extraction of
gamma_E1E1 and gamma_M1M1 with only a small systematic error due to
the dependence on the theoretical models needed to extract the polarizabilities
from the observed asymmetries.<p>

Given the theoretical interest and new opportunities
presented by the new polarized target, we are highly optimistic that the
experiment will run in 2010 or 2011.<p>

<h4>3b. Proton Spin Structure Functions at Large x</h4>

Nucleon spin asymmetries at large x can aid our understanding of
non-perturbative QCD in a unique region where the sea quarks have been stripped
away.  They not only yield clues about spin-flavor symmetry breaking in the
confinement regime, but they are essential for the determination of all but the
first moment of the spin structure functions.  These moments are the natural
connection between experiment and Lattice QCD, since lattice calculations do
not directly compute observables like A<sub>1p</sub> but only the lowest moments of the
various polarized and unpolarized parton distribution functions.
Unfortunately, the trend of the A<sub>1p</sub> data is completely inadequate for
estimating all but the first moment.  The goal of E03-109 is to extract, in a
model-independent fashion, the proton A<sub>1p</sub> (limited by systematic errors) and
simultaneously perform a statistics-limited measurement of g<sub>2p</sub> in the range
0.3<x<0.8.  To do this, the beam-target spin asymmetries A<sub>perp</sub> A<sub>parallel</sub> will
be measured in inclusive inelastic electron scattering at an average <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> of 4.5
GeV<sup>2</sup>.  The expected quality of the data (see figure below) will allow the x
dependence at constant <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> of g<sub>1p</sub> and g<sub>2p</sub>, their third moments, as well as
their <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> dependence, to be studied.  From these quantities, it should also be
possible to determine d<sub>2</sub>, one of the cleanest signatures of higher twist
effects, with less than half of the existing uncertainty.  The elastic
contribution to d<sub>2</sub> is expected to be small and become progressively smaller
over the range of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> covered by the measurement.<p>

E03-109 will use a novel non-magnetic electron telescope, based on the
calorimeter under assembly for E01-102, supplemented with segmented Cerenkov
detectors for particle identification, and tracking detectors.
The experiment is presently planned to run in late 2008 and early 2009.<p>

<h4>3c. Proton Form Factor Ratio</h4>

While the proton magnetic form factor (G<sub>Mp</sub>) has been
measured with sufficient accuracy and over a wide <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> region, the electric form
factor (G<sub>Ep</sub>) is poorly measured, by comparison.  Of particular importance is
the relative dependence of these two form factors as a function of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>, as their ratio
may be related to the more fundamental ratio of the Pauli to Dirac form fators
F<sub>2p</sub>/F<sub>1p</sub>.  In the hard-scattering regime, one expects F<sub>2p</sub>/F<sub>1p</sub> to scale as
1/<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>, while at experimentally accessible <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> the ratio should fall more slowly
due to higher twist and other soft contributions.<p>

<center>

</center>

Jones et al. [PRL <b>84</b>(2000)1398] was the first JLab experiment to apply
the polarization transfer technique, using a focal plane polarimeter, instead
of the Rosenbluth separation technique to extract G<sub>Ep</sub> with high precision and
free of systematic uncertainties.  The results in the range of <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>=0.5-3.5
GeV<sup>2</sup> attracted a lot of interest, with over 250 citations to date.  Our
collaboration extended these measurements up to <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>=5.6 GeV<sup>2</sup> in a subsequent
measurement [PRL <b>88</b>(2002)092301].  The results of the two experiments
(see figure above) indicate a remarkable scaling of F<sub>2p</sub>/F<sub>1p</sub> with 1/Q, ruling
out a number of model calculations.  They also indicate that the Rosenbluth
separation technique is limited in ability to accurately extract the form
factors at high <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>, likely because of radiative corrections due to multiple
photon exchange.  Interestingly, the polarization transfer method is highly
insensitive to these effects, so it appears to be the only viable method for
extracting the proton electric form factor at <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i> above 2 GeV<sup>2</sup>.<p>

</center>

Extending these measurements up to <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>=9 GeV<sup>2</sup>
required an expanded lead-glass calorimeter and the construction of a new focal
plane polarimeter in Hall C.  This experiment completed data taking
in 2008 and first results are expected in 2009.  We plan to extend these
measurements further, to <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>=14 GeV<sup>2</sup> after the
completion of the 12 GeV upgrade.<p>
