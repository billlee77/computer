<p><h3>Opportunities for postdocs, graduates and undergraduates:</h3></p>

<p class="style2">If you are interested in experimental work at the interface
between nuclear and particle physics, please <a href="./contact.html"
target="_self">contact</a> me.</p>

<h4>Graduate Students:</h4>

There are several project opportunities for M.Sc. students.  Possible near-term
and intermediate-term projects include:

<ul>

<li> Gain calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter needed in the
G<sub>Ep</sub>/G<sub>Mp</sub> and Spin Structure Function experiments.<p>

<li> SHMS heavy gas Cerenkov detector simulations and prototyping.<p>

</ul>

While we are not actively recruiting new graduates students right now, we
always consider applications from exceptional individuals.  Applicants should
apply through the UofR Physics Department, have a first class academic
standing, fellowship funding, intense motivation, and solid reference letters
attesting to a strong ability to do research at the undergraduate level.
Students seeking funding through fellowships should check out the fellowship
opportunities listed <a
href="http://www.phys.uregina.ca/info/graduate/financial" target="_self">
here</a>. Please <a href="./contact.html" target="_self">contact</a> Dr. Huber
for more information.<p>

The application deadline for September admission is May 15. Please refer to
the<a href="http://www.phys.uregina.ca/info/graduate/applicant" target="_self">
UofR Physics Graduate Applicant FAQ</a> for more information.<p>


<h4>Undergraduate Summer Research Assistant:</h4>

There are several project opportunities for summer research assistants.  At the
moment, they are primarily based on the analysis of electron scattering data
obtained at JLab.

<ul>

<li> Analysis of high -t <i>pi<sup>+</sup></i> production data.<p>

<li> Simulations and analysis of high -t <i>omega<sup>0</sup></i> production data.<p>

</ul>

Our group does not hire undergraduate researchers directly, but does
occasionally accept exceptional volunteer undergraduate researchers (apply 
by sending a cover letter, CV, and copy of your transcript to Dr. 
Huber).<p>

We also participate in the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards program
(Canadians only).  More information is listed <a
href="http://www.phys.uregina.ca/info/undergrad/NSERC" target="_self">
here</a>.<p>

<h4>Post-doctoral Research Fellow:</h4>

Some possible projects (in order of priority) include:

<ul>
<li>Completion of <i>pi<sup>+</sup>/pi<sup>-</sup></i> response function analysis.  
This could be a first-author opportunity.<p>

<li> Modelling of the 12 GeV F<sub>pi</sub> experiment, including full 
simulations with error analysis;
how well do we have to determine the kinematic offsets?  How would modifications 
to the SHMS design to increase the solid angle for other experiments impact 
F<sub>pi</sub>?<p>

<li>Contribute to the G<sub>Ep</sub>/G<sub>Mp</sub> and Spin Structure 
Function experiments scheduled to run in Hall C in the next several years.<p>

<li> SHMS heavy gas Cerenkov simulation, design, and prototyping tests, including
detailed studies of
SHMS optics, simulation of photon transport, control system for (safe) changing of
gas pressure, prototype tests to check the photoelectron number, and work with
Hall C designer to produce final drawings.<p>

<li>Investigating related experiments, such as L-T separations at fixed
x.  The L response has relevance with respect to GPD's (especially the
pi<sup>-</sup>/pi<sup>+</sup> ratio R<sub>L</sub> 
in which higher order corrections may cancel) while
the T-response should correspond to quark knockout and have close ties to DIS,
where the <i>pi<sup>-</sup>/pi<sup>+</sup></i> 
ratio is predicted to be 1/4.  This could be a good
co-spokesperson opportunity.<p>
</ul>

We are always looking for gifted postdoctoral researchers through the NSERC
postdoctoral fellowship program.  Please visit the <a
href="http://www.nserc.gc.ca" target="_self">NSERC website</a> for more
information or <a href="./contact.html" target="_self">contact</a> Dr. Huber
directly.<p>
