<h4>Graduate Students:</h4>

Funding is available for several students.  Depending on your interests and
goals, you would have the opportunity to contribute to both projects, or
concentrate your efforts on one.<p>

<b>Proton structure studies in Mainz, Germany.</b>  
Proton spin polarizabilities are fundamental observables of proton structure,
and are sensitive to the internal dynamics of the internal QCD constituents
that make up the proton's spin.  Our experiment will utilize both polarized
beams and target in order to extract all four of the proton's spin
polarizabilities for the first time.  Students would gain experience working in
an international collaboration, yet the facility is small enough for the
student to be exposed to nearly every aspect of the experiment.  Research would
include data analysis and simulations performed in Canada, and laboratory work
in Germany.  For more details see the <a 
href="./research.html">research page</a>.<p>

<b>Cerenkov Detector Development.</b> This detector will be used for
pion/kaon separation in Hall C at Jefferson Lab.  Research would include
simulations, detector prototyping, and testing.  The student may also have the
opportunity to contribute to other hardware and software projects in Hall C.<p>

<b>How to Apply:</b>
Applicants should have a first class academic standing, intense motivation, and
solid reference letters attesting to a strong ability to do research at the
undergraduate level.  Preference will be given to applicants with relevant
prior experience in nuclear or particle physics research.  Foreign
applicants are typically expected to write the TOEFL or IELTS English
proficiency exams.  The relevant application forms can be found <a
