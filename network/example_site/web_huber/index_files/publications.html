I am the co-spokesperson (with H. Blok - Free University of Amsterdam and
D. Mack - Jefferson Lab) of an experimental program that aims to significantly
improve our knowledge of the pion charge form factor in the space-like region.
Because the pion has a relatively simple <i>q-qbar</i> valence structure, this
observable is of particular interest -- it is one of the most direct ways of
testing QCD-based models in the non-perturbative regime.  Thus, it is an
observable that all QCD-based calculations use as a first test case (the
``positronium atom'' of QCD).  Our Jefferson Lab data are in the
<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>-region where theoretical calculations for
<i>F<sub>pi</sub></i> begin to diverge, and constrain the treatment of soft
versus hard contributions to the pion wave function.  The publications from
this work have continued impact, to date gathering about 250 citations.  In
addition to the extraction of <i>F<sub>pi</sub></i> from the
<i>p(e,e'pi<sup>+</sup>)n</i> data, E01-004 will also yield papers on
<i>pi<sup>-</sup>\pi<sup>+</sup></i> cross section ratios from deuterium, and
<i>p(e,e'p)omega<sup>0</sup></i> data at high <i>-t</i>.<p>

Physical Review C <b>71</b> (2005) 055202, arXiv:nucl-ex/0501018.
</blockquote>

Jefferson Lab's intense, high duty-factor polarized beam has allowed the
proton's electric to magnetic form factor ratio, G<sub>Ep</sub>/G<sub>Mp</sub>,
	to be
measured with unprecedented accuracy and precision.  These measurements were
performed using the polarization transfer technique, where the ratio of the
transverse and longitudinal polarization components transferred from the
incident electron to the recoil proton is directly proportional to the form
factor ratio, as opposed to the `Rosenbluth' technique (previously used at SLAC
and elsewhere).  Our data unambiguously indicate
	<i>mu</i>G<sub>Ep</sub><<G<sub>Mp</sub> for
<i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>>2 GeV<sup>2</sup>, contradicting the typical assumption
<i>mu</i>G<sub>Ep</sub>=G<sub>Mp</sub>.
This finding continues to motivate many theoretical studies of proton
structure, accruing over 800 citations to date.  This publication is the
archival article giving the full details of this ground-breaking measurement.<p>

QCD predicts that at sufficiently high momentum transfers, the
quark-gluon wave packets of hadrons can be produced as a color neutral object
of reduced transverse size.  If this compact size is maintained for some
distance in traversing the nuclear medium, the hadron would pass undisturbed
through the medium, leading to a phenomenon known as ``color transparency''
(CT).  Exclusive pion production is a particularly important channel for which
to investigate the presence of CT effects, because the pion's relatively simple
structure and compact size should give rise to the CT phenomenon at low
momentum transfers, where quark-scale effects are not normally seen.  Our data,
the clearest identification to date of the CT effect in the lower energy
regime, were also selected as a ``Physical Review Focus'' article.<p>

I was co-spokesperson of two experiments at TAGX to measure rho<sup>0</sup> vector meson
photoproduction, on <sup>3</sup>He (ES-134, G.J.  Lolos, G.M. Huber, and K. Maruyama) and
on d, 12C (ES-144, G.M. Huber, Z.  Papandreou).  The motivation of these
experiments was to test the prediction of many QCD-based models that the mass
and/or width properties of the rho<sup>0</sup> meson are modified in the nuclear medium.
Our data provide adequate systematics across a variety of light
nuclei with different densities to discern the medium-modification effect.
A number of papers on our work have been published, of which the above work is
the most recent.<p>

This manuscript presents the most thorough analysis to identify any Delta-NN
component in <sup>3</sup>He to date, by comparing
pi<sup>+</sup>p/pi<sup>-</sup>p photoproduction ratios in the
1 GeV region.  This follows an idea originally raised by Lipkin and Lee in 1987
[PLB <b>182</b>(1987)22], but with a number of refinements.  A lower limit to
the configuration probability of 1.5+/-0.6+/-0.5% was extracted.  This work was
largely due to my initiative, in that the data we had from a separate
experiment for which I was co-spokesperson, could contain evidence of this small
physical effect in addition to the main justification of the experiment.  This
required a completely different analysis of the data, and a very extensive
simulation effort.<p>

This is the main work resulting from our former research program at the
Brookhaven AGS.  The partial width of the eta's pi<sup>0</sup>gamma-gamma
decay is a sensitive test of chiral perturbation theory calculations, and the
experimental result was found to be consistent with these predictions.
