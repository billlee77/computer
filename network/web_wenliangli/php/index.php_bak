<h2 class="secheader">You Are More Than Welcome </h2>
<p class="lettercontent">Dear visiter, my name is Wenliang Li, also know
 as Bill. This is the first website I have ever created. The main 
purpose is to explore the knowledge and syntax of HTML and others. As a 
part of personal experience, I think the best way to learn programing 
skills is to practically use it, remember things while achieving goals. 
There are infinite amount of things to learn, learning programing is 
perhaps not a matter of remembering but a mattering of doing. I am very 
happy to share my little experience, including studying abroad, being a 
physics student, basic programing knowledge and some funning stuff over 
the years.</p>
<br>

<h2 class="secheader">What You May Find In Here</h2>
<p class="lettercontent">First of all, I have been been studying physics
 student for four years, and I know very little about the subject, I 
will share my version of physics in this website. The self 
interpretation on the matter may contradict the view others, therefore I
 apologise in advance for the lack of knowledge and naive understanding.
 The statement shows on this website are totally self sprited, my 
apology for any possible similar statement.</p>

<p class="lettercontent">I only had a short career with computer 
programing and linux usage, however I am more than willing to share the 
limited knowledge and experience. I am familiar with the following 
subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li> Basic C++ with ROOT
</li><li> Basic BASH
</li><li> Basic FORTRAN 90
</li><li> Basic IDL
</li><li> Basic HTML
</li><li> Basic Latex
</li><li> Some Hacking Trick : )
</li></ul>


<p class="lettercontent">As I claimed I have only had very short 
programing age (less than a year), if you are a beginner on some of 
these subject, may be you will find something that is useful here. </p>

<p class="lettercontent">The last thing you may find is some funny stuff
 I collected over the year from different counties. Some are quite 
funning, however some can be offensive depend on your oriatation. I do 
fully apologize for any possible frustration. I have not host any 
authority or responsibility on any media product that I introduce.
