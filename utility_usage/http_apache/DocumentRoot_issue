You got "DocumentRoot must be a directory" error even it is really a
directory because of SELinux extensions. Run
system-config-securitylevel (or redhat-config-securitylevel) to
disable SELinux for httpd or give SELinux permissions to that
directory:

chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/directory
