<h2>Scheduled Activity: cron and at</h2>

</p><p>
The Linux utilities <b>cron</b> and <b>at</b> are related
commands. The cron utility allows you to schedule a repetitive
task to take place at any regular interval desired, and the at
command lets you specify a one-time action to take place at
some desired time. You might use crontab, for example, to
perform a backup each morning at 2 a.m., and use at to remind
yourself of an appointment later in the day.

</p><h3>Using crontab</h3>

The word ``crontab'' is a UNIXism for chron table, or time
table. You create a table in the required format, specifying
commands and times to execute the commands. Commands you put in
the table can be any executable programs, for example, a
command in /usr/bin or a shell script you wrote. You use the
crontab command to create, edit, or list the table, and the
system cron daemon reads the table and executes the commands at
the times specified.

<p>
<b>The cron Daemon</b>
</p><p>
The cron daemon is normally executed at system startup and
does not exit.  On my Linux system, the cron daemon is actually
Matthew Dillon's <b>crond</b>, and is started in /etc/rc.d/rc.M
with the following line:

</p><pre>/usr/sbin/crond -l10 &gt;&gt;/var/adm/cron 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
On some Linux systems, Paul Vixie's cron daemon is used, in which case
the name of the daemon is simply <b>cron</b>.  Also, on systems with
newer versions of init, cron is started from the /etc/init.d/cron
script.

</p><p>
You can check to see if a cron daemon is running on your system
with a command such as the following:

</p><pre>$ ps -ax | grep cron
raithel  733  pp0 S   0:00 grep cron
root      25   ?  S   0:00 /usr/sbin/crond -l10
</pre>

In this case, we see that the <b>crond</b> daemon is indeed running.

<h4>The crontab Table</h4>

When the cron daemon starts, it reads the various crontab tables in the
crontab directory, normally /usr/spool/cron/crontabs. To create or
change your crontab file, use crontab's <b>-e</b> option:

<pre>$ crontab -e
</pre>

You are placed in a text editor with a copy of your current crontab
file if it exists, or a blank file if it does not. The text editor you
get is determined by the setting of your <tt>VISUAL</tt> (or
<tt>EDITOR</tt>, if <tt>VISUAL</tt> 
is not set) environment variable,
and is usually the <b>vi</b> editor if you have not specified
otherwise.

<p>
To schedule commands with crontab, you must use the format
crontab recognizes in a file. The format is not exactly
mnemonic, so I create a crontab file with a commented-out
header that provides the necessary information:

</p><pre># minute (0-59),
#    hour (0-23),
#       day of the month (1-31),
#          month of the year (1-12),
#             day of the week (0-6, 0=Sunday),
#                command
</pre>
Each crontab entry is a single line composed of these six
fields separated by whitespace. Specify the minute a command is
to be executed with the digits 0 through 59 in the first field,
the hour with 0 through 23 in the second field, the day of the
month with 1 through 31 in the third field, the month of the
year with 1 through 12 in the fourth field, and the day of the
week with 0 through 6 in the fifth field. Place the command to
be executed in the sixth field.

<p>
At first glance it may appear that redundant or conflicting
information is required because there are two ``day''
fields---day of the month and day of the week, but really this
is just to permit different scheduling algorithms. For
instance, you may want to be reminded to attend a meeting every
Tuesday, or to pick up your paycheck every 15th of the month.
Enter an asterisk (*) in the day field you are not using. You
can use both day fields if you prefer to have the command
execute on, say, the fifteenth of the month <b>as
well as</b> every Tuesday.

</p><p>
Ranges are specified with a dash. If you want to specify the
eighth through the fifteenth days of the month, enter
<tt>8-15</tt> in the third field. Non-consecutive entries in a
field are separated by commas, so <tt>1,15</tt> in the third
field means the first and fifteenth of the month. To specify
all values for a field, for example every month of the year,
enter an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) in the field. (Note that to
specify every day you must enter <tt>*</tt> in
<b>both</b> day
fields.)
</p><p>
Here is an example crontab file with two entries:
</p><pre><tt>
# minute (0-59),
#   hour (0-23),
#      day of the month (1-31),
#            month of the year (1-12),
#               day of the week (0-6, 0=Sunday)
#                  command
12  4  *     *  *  /usr/local/bin/backup
5   3  10-15 4  *  echo "taxes due" | mail jones
</tt>
</pre>
The first line after the comments causes a backup script
to execute early each morning at 4:12 a.m., and the second line
causes the user jones to get a mail message for six days in
April as a reminder that taxes are due. In general, it's a good
idea to execute crontab commands at off hours like this to
reduce any affect on system load during normal usage hours.

<p>
If you don't specifically redirect standard error or
standard output, they are mailed to you as owner of the crontab
file when the command executes. In the example above, if the
user jones cannot be found, you would be mailed the output as
well as an error message.

</p><p>
After editing the crontab file, save it and exit from the
editor. A file is created for you in the crontab directory. For
example, the crontab for root is the file
/usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root. This file is read by the system
cron daemon and stored in an internal format where it will
remain to be periodically executed until it is changed or
deleted.

</p><p>
To view your current crontab file, use the <tt>-l</tt> (for
``list'') option:
</p><pre>$ crontab -l
</pre>

To delete your file, use:

<pre>$ crontab -d
</pre>

If you are superuser, you can delete any user's crontab file
with:
<pre># crontab -d <i>username</i>
</pre>

where <tt><i>username</i></tt> is the user's login name.

<p>
The crontab commands discussed above work fine on my Linux
system, and should work on System V and BSD UNIX systems as
well. One thing to be aware of when using crontab on other
systems or moving crontab files to other systems, is that some
cron daemons allow the superuser to restrict crontab service by
the creation of cron.allow and cron.deny files. Refer to the
specific system documentation for details.
</p><p>
Also, most versions of cron provide an /etc/crontab file which has
an extra field in it---the user as which to execute the command.
Again, check the documentation for your version of cron for more
details.

</p><h4>Using at</h4>

Use <b>at</b> when you want to execute a command or multiple
commands once at some future time.
<p>
In Linux, the at command requires that the atrun command be
started in root's crontab file. Many Linux distributions ship
with at enabled, but some do not. To enable the at utility on
your system, become superuser and edit root's crontab file:

</p><pre>$ su root
Password:
# crontab -e
</pre>
and add the following line:

<pre>* * * * * <i>directory</i>/atrun
</pre>

where <tt><i>directory</i></tt> is the location where the
atrun executable is stored. On my system that's /usr/lib, so
the entry is:
<pre>* * * * * /usr/lib/atrun
</pre>

This causes atrun to be executed every minute. After a
minute or so of adding the atrun line and saving the crontab
file, any existing at commands are evaluated and executed if
the time is right. (Before this, you may have been able to
enter at commands, but they were never executed.)

<p>
To demonstrate the at command, let's have it print ``hello''
on your current terminal window after a few minutes.  First,
get the time and your current terminal device:

</p><pre>$ date
Tue Oct  3 15:33:37 PDT 1995
$ tty
/dev/ttyp2
</pre>

Now run the at command. Specify a time in the command
line, press Return, and then enter the command, followed by
another Return and a Control-D:

<pre>$ at 15:35
echo "hello" &gt; /dev/ttyp2
^D
Job c00ceb20b.00 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre>

The at command takes input up to the end-of-file character
(press Control-D while at the beginning of a line). It reports
the job number and informs you that it will use /bin/sh to
execute the command. In two minutes, <tt>hello</tt> should
appear on the display of /dev/ttyp2. Note that you can enter a
series of commands, one per line---at will read each line up to
the end-of-file and execute the file as a /bin/sh shell script
at the specified time.

Suppose you want to set an alarm. One way to tell at to do
something is to use the relative form of timing, specifying a
time relative to <tt>now</tt>. If you want your computer to
beep at you in 25 minutes, enter:

<pre>$ at now + 25 minutes
echo ^G &gt; /dev/ttyp4
^D
Job c00ceb7fb.00 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre>

and you are beeped in 25 minutes. There is a great deal of
flexibility allowed in entering time specifications. For
example, at recognizes military time, ``am'' and ``pm'', month
abbreviations, times including the year, and so on. My at man
page even claims that at accepts <tt>teatime</tt>,
<tt>noon</tt>, and other constructs. Refer to the at man page
for more examples of valid time specifications.

<p>
You must tell at your tty location or it won't send output to
your terminal window. If you prefer, you can receive mail:

</p><pre>$ at 4:55pm Friday
echo '5 p.m. meeting with Carol' | mail raithel
^D
Job c00ceb7fb.01 will be executed using /bin/sh
</pre>

To get a list of your pending at jobs, enter:

<pre>$ atq
</pre>

If you are superuser, atq shows you the pending
at jobs of all users. To delete a job, enter:

<pre>$ atrm <i>job_number</i>
</pre>

where <tt><i>job_number</i></tt> is the job number returned by
atq. The superuser can also remove other user's jobs.

<h4>A Reminder Script Using at</h4>

The following is a simple script that makes it easier for me
to use at to send myself reminders. The script sends mail to
the user containing the message line(s) entered at the prompt
at the time specified. It also displays some syntax examples of
how to specify time, which I find a useful memory refresher.

<p>
Note that the script as written requires you to have a Temp
directory in your home directory. I created a $HOME/Msgs rather
than use something like /usr/tmp so that the messages are more
private until they are deleted by the script.

</p><pre>#!/bin/sh

echo "Enter your reminder message.
When finished, enter a period (.) at
the beginning of a line and press Enter.
(Or press Ctrl-C or DEL to exit.)"

while :
do
    read MESSAGE
    if [ "$MESSAGE" = "." ]
    then
        break
    else
        echo $MESSAGE &gt;&gt; $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
    fi
done

cat &lt;&lt; !!
Enter time and day you want to receive
the message, for example:

      0815am Jan 24
      8:15am Jan 24
      now + 1 day
      5 pm Friday

Then press Enter.

!!
read TIME

echo "at $TIME mail $LOGNAME $HOME/Msgs/message.$$"

at $TIME  &lt;&lt; !!
mail $LOGNAME &lt; $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
rm -f $HOME/Msgs/message.$$
!!
exit 0
</pre>

<h4>Some Final Thoughts</h4>

The user's interface to the crontab and at commands is very
similar across different versions on UNIX, but implementations
of underlying directory structures, daemons, and access
controls may differ. Be sure to review your system
documentation to take advantage of all aspects of these
powerful commands.

<p>
There's practically no limit to the use of crontab and at, but
a few words of warning. First, consider security issues when
enabling user crontab and at permissions. Obviously, a
disgruntled co-worker could leave a ``time-bomb'' of some sort,
limited only by their other permission restrictions. Many
versions of crontab and at allow you to specify ``allow'' and
``deny'' files to control which users have access to the
utilities. You could also use root's crontab to check for and
remove user crontabs (or any other files) if you want to.

</p><p>
Also, debug your crontab file entries thoroughly. Check that
they are working. These entries are usually scheduled to
execute at times of low-usage so it is unlikely you'll be
around to observe them at the time.
