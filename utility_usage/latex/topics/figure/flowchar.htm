        the details</font></a> </h2>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flowcharting is a 
        tool for analysing processes. It allows you to break any process down 
        into individual events or activities and to display these in shorthand 
        form showing the logical relationships between them. Constructing flowcharts 
        promotes better understanding of processes, and better understanding of 
        processes is a pre-requisite for improvement. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examples of processes 
        are "Receiving orders and entering them into the computer system" 
        or "Converting dry-mix powder into tablet form" or "Following-up 
        sales enquiries". The events which make up a process, and which appear 
        in the flowchart, may be of any type. For example, they may be "taking 
        a phone call", "completing an order form", "printing 
        a report", "deciding between a number of alternatives", 
        and so on. The symbols used to represent each event may take any form. 
        They may be boxes, circles, diamonds or other shapes, or events may simply 
        be described in words. Connections between events are always represented 
        by lines; usually with arrowheads to show the direction or order in which 
        they occur. These lines represent the flow of activity in the process 
        being described; hence the name of the technique. (See the example in 
        the `How to use it' section of this document.) </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are specialised 
        applications for flowcharting (such as in computer systems design and 
        programming, engineering, and science) which use standardised sets of 
        symbols. You must decide for yourself whether these need to be used in 
        your particular management application. In most circumstances this will 
        either not be necessary or you can rely on three or four simple symbols 
        to cover most types of events. A useful set of symbols is given in the 
        `How to use it' section below. For special standardised symbols, see the 
        `Other references' section of this document for sources you can refer 
        to. </font></p>

      <h3><font color="#009999" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flowcharting 
        to help clarify what actually happens or needs to happen </font></h3>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organisational activity 
        involves many separate tasks. These are often complex and they change 
        over time in response to new customer demands, new product and service 
        requirements, or new laws and regulations. These changes are often made 
        in isolated, reactive and piecemeal ways, which are not necessarily best 
        for the company or the people doing the work. In addition to external 
        pressures for change, there is a constant need to search for new and better 
        ways to do things in order to maintain a competitive edge, and to make 
        life easier and more interesting for those who do the work. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only way to control 
        change, rather than have it control you, is to clarify what actually happens 
        and to decide whether this is the way you want it or not. By grouping 
        tasks into logical areas of activity (processes) and drawing flowcharts 
        of the events which occur, it is possible to get a concise picture of 
        the way particular processes are completed within the organisation. This 
        makes it easier for you to move on to the next logical step which is to 
        make changes for the better. This is because the flowcharting exercise 
        will point you in the right direction to collect and analyse relevant 
        statistics, examine other processes which relate to the one flowcharted, 
        and pursue critical policy or procedure problems. </font></p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="special note on team"><font color="#000099"><b>A 
        special note on team flowcharting</b></font></a> </font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="special note on team"></a></font></h4>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flowcharting, as 
        a tool for clarifying situations and thus improving knowledge and understanding, 
        is particularly useful when used by a group or team. This is because by 
        drawing a flowchart together, the team, </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">develops a common 
          understanding of the situation</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">contributes a 
          larger pool of knowledge than an individual can (assuming team members 
          are well chosen for their knowledge and experience)</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">can agree a common 
          approach to solving problems, resolving ambiguities and making improvements</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Team leaders will 
        find that drawing a flowchart progressively on a whiteboard or flipchart, 
        as team members contribute their information, opinions and ideas, will 
        not only identify problems and areas of confusion, but will automatically 
        build consensus and commitment by focusing the team's attention on a single 
        shared view of their task. Be warned, however, that while flowcharting 
        looks easy to do, it takes practice to use effectively. It forces users 
        to identify process steps so that they are clear and logical, which is 
        of course its principal purpose. </font></p>
      <h3><font color="#009999" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flowcharting 
        to help communicate what actually happens or needs to happen </font></h3>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After taking stock 
        of a process by flowcharting it, the final form of the flowchart (which 
        should describe the process clearly and unambiguously) can then be used 
        to communicate to others. Communication of processes is important for 
        two reasons,

      <ul>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">people who are 
          new to particular processes need to learn them and be able to refer 
          to information about them</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the organisation 
          benefits considerably from standardised processes and these must be 
          clearly communicated to be effective</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flowcharts can either 
        be distributed unchanged to communicate processes, or they can be used 
        to help prepare logically structured and clearly written policies and 
        procedures. </font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are no hard 
        and fast rules for constructing flowcharts, but there are guidelines which 
        are useful to bear in mind.<br>
        Here are six steps which can be used as a guide for completing flowcharts. 
        </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">describe the process 
          to be charted (this is a one-line statement such as, "How to fill 
          the car's petrol tank")</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">start with a 'trigger' 
          event</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">note each successive 
          action concisely and clearly</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">go with the main 
          flow (put extra detail in other charts)</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">make cross references 
          to supporting information</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">follow the process 
          through to a useful conclusion (end at a 'target' point)</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The best way to illustrate 
        the use of these guidelines is to look at a simple example (see below) 
        and follow how each step has been applied. </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first step 
          is to identify the process to be flowcharted and to give the chart a 
          title. In this case, it is `How to fill the car's petrol tank'.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Begin to draw 
          the chart by first describing the event which initiates the process 
          (the 'trigger'). In the example this is `Low petrol warning light comes 
          on'.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then note down 
          each successive action taken. Actions should be described in as few 
          words as possible, but make sure the description is not ambiguous or 
          unclear.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you reach 
          a point at which the flowchart branches into a number of alternatives, 
          and the resulting complexity threatens to overwhelm the exercise, choose 
          the most important alternative to continue flowcharting with. The others 
          can simply be terminated and dealt with in separate flowcharts. Such 
          a point is illustrated in the example where a decision is required on 
          how much petrol is to be put in the tank.</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Often you may 
          need to make cross-references to important supporting information (in 
          this example cross references may be made to, say, a table of preferred 
          brands of petrol, or to a list of cars able to use unleaded petrol).</font></li>
        <li><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continue describing 
          each event, action or decision as it occurs in sequence, until the process 
          is concluded. In the example, this point is reached when the petrol 
          is paid for, the tank is recharged, and you are ready to drive off.</font></li>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a flowchart 
        describes a process in which a number of different people, departments, 
        or functional areas are involved, it is sometimes difficult to keep track 
        of who is responsible for each step. A useful additional technique for 
        tracking this, and for analysing the number of times a process is 'handed 
        over' to different people, is to divide the flowchart into columns. Head 
        up each column with the name of the person or function involved in the 
        process, and each time they carry out an action show it in their column. 
        This is illustrated in the flowchart below which covers a simple purchasing 
        process. It shows how control of the process passes from the person initiating 
        the purchase, to the Purchasing Dept. and then to the Supplier.</font></p>

        necessary to use boxes, circles, diamonds or other such symbols to construct 
        a flowchart, but these do help to describe the types of events in the

        are applicable to most situations without being overly complex. </font></p>

        Rounded box - use it to represent an event which occurs automatically. 
        Such an event will trigger a subsequent action, for example `receive telephone

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="flowchar_files/square.gif" width="64" height="49"> 
        Rectangle or box - use it to represent an event which is controlled within 
        the process. Typically this will be a step or action which is taken. In 
        most flowcharts this will be the most frequently used symbol. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="flowchar_files/diamnd.gif" width="64" height="49"> 
        Diamond - use it to represent a decision point in the process. Typically, 
        the statement in the symbol will require a `yes' or `no' response and 
        branch to different parts of the flowchart accordingly. </font></p>
