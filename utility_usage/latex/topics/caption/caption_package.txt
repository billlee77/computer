if you know or find out the width of the table, let's say 5cm -
if you're using a KOMA-Script class:
\setcapwidth[c]{5cm}
if you're using the caption package:
\captionsetup{width=5cm}

Both may be applied inside the table environment.

An automatically calculating solution is more complicated, but could be done using the \settowidth command.
