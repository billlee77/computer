I rate myself as a consistent and cautious team player, hold effective communication skills and keen on planning ahead. Despite being a physics student, it is also my interest to explore computer programing and maintenance. Fore more than 10 tears of the studying and living abroad, I managed to survive five countries in three continents. Thus, one of my biggest advantages is the ability to adapt into the new working and living environment in short period of time. Never the less, my international experience may be beneficial to the group.



\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
