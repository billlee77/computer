\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}
 
I am writing to apply to the 3 year PHd position starts at fall 2010. I have enclosed a copy of full Curriculum Vitea, transcript, 2 sets of recommandation letter and progress report of my reseearch report from my supervaser.

As you may notice from my CV, I am a final year M-Physics at University of Kent in UK, 
 

With 8 years of experience studying and living abroad, there would no difficulties for me to adapt into a new environment quickly. 

I would be grateful if you could consider offering the opportunity to allow me to study more advanced theoritical and particle physics for the next 3 years.

I look forward to your reply.
 
\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
