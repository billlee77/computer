    <h1 align="center">High quality PDF output from LaTeX and TeX</h1>

    <p>When converting PostScript output from TeX or LaTeX to PDF,
    the resulting documents are of very low quality, if no special
    steps are taken to avoid font rendering problems.</p>

    <p>There are several ways of producing PDF output from LaTeX/TeX
    files. The one I use is to produce a PostScript file, using
    dvips, and then convert that to PDF using Acrobat Distiller or
    GhostScript's ps2pdf command. This is the approach covered here,
    although some of it might be applicable to other ones.

    </p><p>The problem is that by default TeX/LaTeX uses bitmap (i.e., Type 3)
    fonts instead of scalable Type 1 or TrueType fonts. These bitmap fonts
    are generated at the printer's resolution, which is typically 300 or 600
    dpi. Changing the resolution of bitmap fonts is no easy task and
    therefore the PDF readers produce terrible results when displaying these
    fonts on the screen. Furthermore, printing quality can be quite deceiving
    if the printer's resolution does not match the one of the bitmap
    font.</p>

    <p>The solution to the problem is to force TeX/LaTeX to use Type 1
    fonts in the PostScript output (PS). Since these fonts are
    scalable then the PDF file will display and print well at all
    resolutions.

    </p><p>In order to force Type 1 fonts there are basically two ways that I
    know of: use the standard PostScript fonts and/or use Type 1 versions
    of the Computer Modern fonts. These approaches can, in general, be used
    together.

    </p><p>Computer Modern (CM) fonts are the original TeX fonts designed
    by Knuth, which are used by default in many TeX/LaTeX
    distributions. There also exist the EC fonts, which are basically
    the same but with an extended encoding, providing more characters
    for non-English alphabets.

    </p><p>Note that you can additionally use the <tt>hyperref</tt> package to
    generate hyperlinked PDF files, as explained in my <a href="http://dsanta.users.ch/resources/hyperref.html">hyperref</a> page.

    </p><h2>Short version</h2>

    Follow these steps to get a good looking PDF file with LaTeX. If you still
    experience problems, or are curious, keep on reading the long explanation.

    <ol type="1">
      <li>Make sure you have one of the following in your latex preamble.
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>To use the CM and EC fonts (usually recommended):
	    <blockquote><tt>
		\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}<br>
		\usepackage{ae,aecompl}<br>
	      </tt></blockquote>
	    Optionally the <tt>aeguill</tt> package can also be loaded to get
	    French guillemets.
	  </li><li>To use standard PostScript fonts:
	    <blockquote><tt>
		\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}<br>
		\usepackage{pslatex}<br>
	      </tt></blockquote>

	    Alternatively, you can use the <tt>pslatex</tt> command in step 2
	    below instead of <tt>latex</tt>, which automatically includes the
	    <tt>pslatex</tt> package.

	</li></ol>
      </li><li>Compile your latex file as usual. For example:
	<blockquote><tt>
	    latex file.tex
	  </tt></blockquote>
      </li><li>Convert to PostScript with the following command (replace
	<tt>a4</tt> by <tt>letter</tt> if using US letter paper):
	<blockquote><tt>
	    dvips -t a4 -Ppdf file.dvi
	  </tt></blockquote>
	This will create a file with the same name and the <tt>.ps</tt>
	extension.
	If you have a dvips version earlier than 5.90 and you see problems
	with ligatures (e.g., ff) being converted to strange characters use the
	following:
	<blockquote><tt>
	    dvips -t a4 -Ppdf -G0 file.dvi
	  </tt></blockquote>
	(this can however create some problems with some versions of Acrobat
	Reader). If you have an old dvips that does not have the pdf
	pseudo printer, use

	<blockquote><tt>
	    dvips -t a4 -Pcmz -Pamz file.dvi -o
	  </tt></blockquote>

      </li><li>Convert the PostScript file to PDF with <tt>ps2pdf</tt> or using
	Acrobat Distiller. For example:
	<blockquote><tt>
	    ps2pdf file.ps
	  </tt></blockquote>
    </li></ol>

    <p>The file should now display and print with very good quality. Note that
    when using the EC fonts, some characters may be poorly rendered since they
    are not available as Type 1 fonts and a bitmap is used instead. This
    should only affect some accented characters and eastern European
    languages.

    </p><h2>Long version</h2>

    <h3>The font encoding</h3>

    <p>LaTeX can use several font encodings. Typical installations use the OT1
    encoding by default, which is the original encoding. However, this
    encoding is suitable to English only. The more recent T1 encoding includes
    accented characters and can handle hyphenation of words with accented
    characters. T1 is therefore the recommended encoding. To define the
    encoding include the following at the start of the LaTeX preamble:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
      </tt></blockquote>

    <p>The type of encoding determines which font is used by default. The OT1
    encoding uses the Computer Modern (CM) fonts, while the T1 encoding uses
    the EC fonts, which are the same as CM but with more glyphs defined.

    </p><h3>Using the Type 1 versions of CM or EC fonts</h3>

    <p>Modern LaTeX distributions include Type 1 versions of the CM fonts,
    under the collective name of <i>bluesky</i>. Otherwise they can be
    obtained from <a href="http://www.ctan.org/">CTAN</a>. There are
    unfortunately no freely available Type 1 version of the EC fonts, so they
    need to be emulated from the CM ones.

    </p><p>If you are using the OT1 encoding nothing particular needs to be done
    to generate the DVI file. With the T1 encoding the following needs to be
    included in your preamble:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	\usepackage{ae,aecompl}
      </tt></blockquote>

    This will substitute the EC fonts with equivalents of the CM fonts, so
    that Type 1 versions of the characters are available when generating the
    PDF. The few symbols in the EC font that cannot be emulated from the ones
    in the CM fonts are taken from the bitmap EC fonts.

    <p>You can also include the <tt>aeguill</tt> package to get French
    guillemets. Note that including the <tt>ae</tt> package will automatically
    set your font encoding to T1.

    </p><h3>Using standard PostScript fonts</h3>

    <p>Alternatively to the CM or EC fonts one can use the standard PostScript
    fonts for the document text. LaTeX includes some packages that replace the
    CM or EC text fonts with standard PostScript fonts, which are Type 1 and
    available in any PostScript or PDF printer or reader.

    </p><p>There are several such packages, providing different font
    substitutions. The main ones are: <tt>times</tt>, <tt>palatino</tt>,
    <tt>newcent</tt> and <tt>bookman</tt>. The <tt>times</tt> package will use
    Times-Roman for the roman font, Courier for typewriter and Helvetica for
    sans serif. To use it add

      </p><blockquote><tt>
	\usepackage{times}
      </tt></blockquote>

    to your preamble. For more information on these and other similar packages
    consult the <tt>psnfss2e</tt> documentation that comes with your LaTeX
    system.

    <p>Note that since the fonts are different from the CM or EC ones, the
    output will be modified. Note also that equations still use the CM fonts
    and thus equations that mix text and mathematical symbols can appear
    distorted, due to the font mismatch.

    </p><p>The <tt>pslatex</tt> package solves the font mismatch problem by
    scaling the fonts and using a mix of Times-Roman italic, CM and other
    fonts for the math mode. It is otherwise similar to the <tt>times</tt>
    package. To use it add

      </p><blockquote><tt>
	\usepackage{pslatex}
      </tt></blockquote>

    to your preamble, instead of <tt>times</tt> or any other such
    package. Alternatively, if you use the <tt>pslatex</tt> command to compile
    your file, instead of <tt>latex</tt>, the package is automatically
    included and no modification is necessary. Again, since the fonts are not
    the same as the default CM or EC fonts the output will look different.

    <p>No that, as far as I know, any package selecting PostScript fonts as
    default cannot be used in conjunction with the <tt>ae</tt> and
    <tt>aecompl</tt> packages since they both redefine the default font.

    </p><h3>Generating a proper PS file</h3>

    <p>In LaTeX distributions the <tt>dvips</tt> command will by default use
    the bitmap CM fonts instead of the Type 1 versions. It is therefore
    necessary to explicitly tell it to use the former. In recent LaTeX
    distributions this is done with the command

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	dvips -Ppdf file.dvi
      </tt>
    </blockquote>

    The <tt>pdf</tt> pseudo printer will use the Type 1 version of the fonts,
    whenever available, and will set some other options to better match PDF
    requirements (e.g., set a very high nominal resolution to avoid some
    "optimizations"). It will create a file with the same name and a
    <tt>.ps</tt> extension.

    <p>Some versions of Acrobat Reader have problems with fonts that have
    characters in positions where the standard Adobe fonts do not, as is the
    case with most LaTeX fonts. To solve this problem the <tt>-G1</tt> switch
    of dvips will relocate such characters to harmless
    positions. This is enabled by default with the <tt>pdf</tt>
    pseudo printer. On dvips versions earlier than 5.90 this will
    however create problems with ligatures in some fonts, where they are
    converted to strange characters. If you have such problems use the
    <tt>-G0</tt> option to disable character remapping, such as:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	dvips -Ppdf -G0 file.dvi
      </tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Old versions of dvips do not have a <tt>pdf</tt> pseudo
    printer. The use of Type 1 fonts can, however, be forced with the
    following command line:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	dvips -Pcmz -Pamz file.dvi -o
      </tt>
    </blockquote>

    Note however that this will not set other options that benefit PDF
    creation.

    <p>If you have used the standard PostScript fonts instead of LaTeX CM or
    EC fonts, the Type 1 versions are used by default (as they are only
    available as Type 1). Nevertheless, some characters from the CM fonts are
    still used and the special options for dvips are required to get optimal
    results.

    </p><p>There is also another issue that arises from TeX's poor handling of the
    paper size. Although the DVI file will be typeset correctly for the paper
    size specified in the document class options, dvips will not explicitely
    set the paper size in the PS file, in an attempt to produce portable
    PS. However, PS to PDF converters will assume a default size (typically US
    letter) that may not match the actual paper size (typically A4 outside
    North America). Furthermore, depending on the distribution dvips will
    assume A4 or letter as the default paper size for converting from DVI to PS
    coordinates. It is therefore safer, and often necessary, to explicitely
    tell dvips to set the PS paper size with the <tt>-t</tt> option. For
      example:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	dvips -t a4 -Ppdf -G0 file.dvi
      </tt></blockquote>

    If you are using US letter paper replace <tt>a4</tt> by <tt>letter</tt>.

    <h3>Converting to PDF</h3>

    <p>The PS file generated above can be converted to PDF using Acrobat
    Distiller or GhostScript's ps2pdf command. Using Distiller is rather
    user-friendly and not covered here.

    </p><p>GhostScript's ps2pdf utility does a very good job converting to
    PDF. Note however that versions up to than 5.50 will convert any Type 1
    font other than the standard PostScript fonts to Type 3 (i.e., bitmap)
    fonts, so make sure you use version 6.50 at least.

    </p><p>To convert to PDF use the command:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	ps2pdf file.ps
      </tt></blockquote>

    This will create a file with the same name and the <tt>.pdf</tt>
    extension. The PDF version used will be GhostScript's default, which is
    currently 1.2. To generate specific PDF versions you can use the
    <tt>ps2pdf12</tt>, <tt>ps2pdf13</tt> or <tt>ps2pdf14</tt> commands, which
    will generate PDF files compatible with Acrobat Reader versions 3 and
    later, 4 and later and 5 and later, respectively.

    <p>Several profiles are provided that select different sets of options and
      are similar to Distiller's settings. They are:

    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>/screen</tt> selects low-resolution output similar to
	Distiller's "Screen Optimized" setting.
      </li><li><tt>/printer</tt> selects output similar to
	Distiller's "Print Optimized" setting.
      </li><li><tt>/prepress</tt> selects output similar to
	Distiller's "Prepress Optimized" setting.
      </li><li><tt>/default</tt> selects good quality output for general purpose
	use, even if the file size might be larger than in the
	<tt>/screen</tt> profile.
    </li></ul>

    The profile can be selected with the <tt>-dPDFSETTINGS</tt> option. For
    example:

    <blockquote><tt>
	ps2pdf13 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen file.ps
      </tt></blockquote>

    <p>If the paper size was not explicitely set when creating the PS file, it
      can be specified in the <tt>ps2pdf</tt> command line. For example:

    </p><blockquote><tt>
	ps2pdf13 -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen file.ps
      </tt></blockquote>

    Note that Acrobat Reader on Linux/Unix, up to at least version 5.06, has a
    bug handling the paper size when printing. Although the page setup dialog
    says A4 as the paper size, you have to select it again each time Acrobat
    Reader is started, as the setting is only partially saved. If this is not
    done, the printed file will have A4 set as the paper size but all the
    computations done for letter, leading to bogus margins.

    <p>More specific settings can also be set, refer to the Ps2pdf.htm file in
    your GhostScript's documentation (you can find it <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/doc/gnu/7.05/Ps2pdf.htm">here</a> for
    version 7.05).
