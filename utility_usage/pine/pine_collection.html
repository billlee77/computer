<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p> A collection in Alpine is a group of folders, or in the case of news, of
newsgroups. The idea of a collection is that you can group your folders
according to the functions that they serve or their location or both.

</p><p> The main collections of folders, are Incoming-Folders, which are used
to receive new mail, which contains the INBOX folder, the Mail collection
which contains folders like sent-mail, or saved-messages, and the News
collection, which contains all the Usenet newsgroup that you are
subscribed to. All these collections are described in more detail below.

</p><h4>How to Add a Collection</h4>

<p> Adding collections is easy, just press <b class="remark">M S L</b> and
you will be able to add one. Once you get to this screen press 
<b class="remark">A</b> to add a collection, and fill in the information.
Here's an example:

</p><p><table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Nickname
</td>
<td align="center">:
</td>
<td>Anything
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Server&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td>
<td align="center">:
</td>
<td>name.server.com/user=userid
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Path&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td>
<td align="center">:
</td>
<td>/full/path/to/location/of/collection
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>View&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td>
<td align="center">:
</td>
<td>&nbsp;
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p> In some servers like <b class="remark">Gmail</b> you can leave the path 
empty, but if you want to see only folders under the <b class="remark">[Gmail]</b> directory, try setting the path to <b class="remark">[[Gmail]/</b> (yes, two left square brackets). Another variation
of this configuration is <b class="remark">[[Google Mail]/</b>, for those
that need access to <b class="remark">[Google Mail]</b>, rather than 
<b class="remark">[Gmail]</b>. Since version 2.0, you can avoid writing the
double left square bracket, and simply write <b class="remark">[Gmail]/</b>
or <b class="remark">[Google Mail]/</b> for the path.

</p><p>The last field <b class="remark">(View)</b> must be left empty if you want
to see all folders, but you can use it to restrict which folders in the
collection you want to have displayed. You can add "archive", say, to
display only folders that contain the string "archive" in it. You can also
use the "<b class="remark">*</b>" wildcard for matching strings. For example
</p><ul>
<li><b class="remark">*s</b> is a folder that ends in "s", like "saved-messages"
</li><li><b class="remark">s</b> is a foder that contains the string "s", like "test"
</li><li><b class="remark">s*</b> does what is expected, matches "sent-mail"
</li><li><b class="remark">s*s</b> does what is expected, matches "saved-messages" but not "sent-mail"
</li><li><b class="remark">s*-m*</b> matches sent-mail, sent-mail-sept-2002 and saved-messages
</li></ul>
note also that case matters, so "S*" and "s*" match two different groups of
folders.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h4>The above instructions do not work for my server!</h4>
You are either using Cyrus or Courier. In this case, the Path field is tricky.
In these servers folders are subfolders of INBOX, so sometimes you must
define
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Path : INBOX.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
(note the trailing dot) and in some other opportunities 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Path : INBOX/
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If for some reason this does not work, then you will need to edit your
.pinerc file and add directly there the following information:
<br>&nbsp;<br>
folder-collections="Something here" {some.server.com}INBOX.[]
<br>&nbsp;<br>
or
<br>&nbsp;<br>
folder-collections="Something here" {some.server.com}INBOX/[]
<br>&nbsp;<br>
One of them should work. (Note: in some browsers the display of the last 
two characters of the definitions of the folder collection looks like a 
rectangle. The last two characters are "[" and "]").
